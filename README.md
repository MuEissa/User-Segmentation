# User Segmentation
### User Behavior on a Food Delivery Platform

This repository contains an analysis of user behavior on a food delivery platform, focusing on purchase patterns, preferred cuisines, and other relevant insights. The analysis provides valuable information for optimizing marketing strategies, improving user experience, and identifying opportunities for expansion or partnerships.

## Key Findings:
- Revenue generation is concentrated in three countries: Finland, Denmark, and Greece.
- Restaurants are the most popular store type for user orders.
- American, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, and Middle Eastern cuisines are the most preferred.
- iOS users tend to spend more than Android users.
- The majority of users are infrequent low-spenders (characterized by users who place orders at an average interval of 20 days and spend less than 100 euros per order).
